Cinema system concept implementing design patterns in Rust

The motivation for this project is to see if I can translate design patterns (implemented in a previous Java project) into Rust.
OO-patterns have never been considered perfect, especially for system development, so it was seemed fun to try to implement these in a safe language :)

Patterns implemented:
[x] State
[x] Strategy
[x] Abstract Factory
[] Observer
